        <h1>What I was able to do in GitHub</h1><br>
        <h2>Add files</h2>
            <p>The first thing that I did after creating the repository and the README file was to create the file named: MainPaige.html</p>
            <p>THis was done easly by clicking and add a file in the webpage.</p>
        <h2>Make a Commit</h2>
            <P>I then added the very basics of an html page and then saved.</P>
            <p>In order to make this available to others as if I was in a group I then needed to Commit and Push to make it publically available.</p>
