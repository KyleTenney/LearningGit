        <h1>What I was able to do in GitHub</h1><br>
        <h2>Add files</h2>
            <p>The first thing that I did after creating the repository and the README file was to create the file named: MainPaige.html</p>
            <p>THis was done easly by clicking and add a file in the webpage.</p>
        <h2>Commit and Push</h2>
            <P>I then added the very basics of an html page and then saved.</P>
            <p>In order to make this available to others as if I was in a group I then needed to Commit and Push to make it publically available.</p>
            <p>Using Commit is basicaly just saving your work and getting ready to add it so that it is avalable for everyonne else.</p>
            <p>Using Push is were all of your most recent commits are then commbined into the branch and are then accesable to others.</p>
        <h2>Fetch and Pull</h2>
            <p>When working in a group there are times where diffrent people are working together on a certain file.</p>
            <p>When doing this it can make it so that they cannot see eachothers code.</p>
            <p>I simulated this by making this line from inside the website.</p>
            <p>On my desktop I was then able to refresh (Fetch) to get any recent changes and then use Pull to update my current code that I'm working on.</p>
        <h2>Branches</h2>
            <p>One of the other things that I learned was how to use branches.</p>
            <p>Branches looked a little difficult to start but after seeing how they work more it looked like a very important part to learn.</p>
            <p>I saw how they can be used for each user but also as a way to keep diffrent working versions of code seperate.</p>
            <p>One example I saw was how they seperated the production branch away from the development branch.</p>
            <p>This is in order to keep the main one running well and the other has incoming changes when ready.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These lines were made in another branch and then will be merged onto the main branch.</p>
            <p>I was able to make a new branch from the desktop and then try to merge it.</p>
            <p>In order to merge I then needed to make a pull request to verify that it should be merged into the main branch.</p>
        <h2>Merge conflicts</h2>
            <p>What can happen is that some of the changes done in the branch would effect the main branch.</p>
            <p>This is something to be carfull of because you do not want to overwrite some things.</p>
